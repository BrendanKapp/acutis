## Background

This project was inspired by LessPhone [LessPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.aswinmohan.nophone) by Aswin Mohan. A launcher I adopted when I descided to take on minimalism as a lifestyle choice. I purged from personal belongings to my digital space. For my phone, I also needed a less distraction solution also, hence **_LessPhone_**. I loved it, _but it worked a little too much_. Do check it out!

**But!** I couldn't do with just 3 apps as daily apps so tah-daaa Slim launcher, everyone! with a couple of bells and whistles.

## Milestones
