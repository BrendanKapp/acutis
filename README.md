## Background

This project was inspired by LessPhone [LessPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.aswinmohan.nophone) by Aswin Mohan. A launcher I adopted when I descided to take on minimalism as a lifestyle choice. I purged from personal belongings to my digital space. For my phone, I also needed a less distraction solution also, hence **_LessPhone_**. I loved it, _but it worked a little too much_. Do check it out!

**But!** I couldn't do with just 3 apps as daily apps so tah-daaa Slim launcher, everyone! with a couple of bells and whistles.

## Milstones

- [x] Release on Google Play _(release the kraken!)_
- [x] Variety of themes
- [x] Clean up README _...continuous_.
- [] Journal (text and audio)
- [] Gesture controls for home screen modes
- [] Tasks (like journal but better)
- [] Figure out whether to fully adopt Material Design or continue mixing with flat principles. Open an issue...if there is one.
- [] Tests and README badges **!important;**
- [] Landing page for the app.
- [] A tutorial series in how to build an android launcher
