        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Where is the app drawer?</h3></li>
            <span>There is no app drawer! You don't need an app drawer when all the apps you need fit in one screen.</span>
            <li><h3>Why can't I access all the other apps on my phone?</h3></li>
            <span>Clearly you didn't understand the whole idea of this app.
                The whole point of this app is to stop you from doing exactly that. Google 'minimalism'</span>
            <li><h3>How do I get to my other apps?</h3></li>
            <span>Well simple! Swipe up from your home screen &gt; Go to Options &gt; Tap Customise apps. have fun!</span>
            <li><h3>You should add a google search bar and a way to access all the other apps.</h3></li>
            <span>First of all this is not a question! Secondly, I do appreciate the feedback but
                let it not be against the reason why the app exists in the first place</span>
            <li><h3>Why can't I set a wallpaper?</h3></li>
            <span>Well why do you want a wallpaper? You want to look at your phone? for how long? for what? For who?
            Read a book instead.</span>
            <li><h3>Hey, your app sucks!</h3></li>
            <span>Where's yours that doesn't suck?!?</span>
            <li><h3>Is it possible to change the apps on the home screen?</h3></li>
            <span>Yes, you can. If you have the latest version installed, you'll find that adding, renaming
            and exchanging apps has been made easier.</span>
            <li><h3>WHAT ABOUT OTHER APPS?</h3></li>
            <span><i>Where's Thanos when you need him the most?...</i> Did you even read the description of the app?</span>
            <li><h3>Does it support other languages?</h3></li>
            <span>No, unfortunately. I would love for the app to be accessible no matter the language.
                But the app is free, I can't afford to pay for translation services as of yet. If you know
            a language that you would like this app to support and you are fluent in it, please shoot me an email and we'll make magic happen</span>
            <li><h3>I have a youtube channel, can I review your app for a small fee? I have many subscribers and
            my videos have millions of views</h3></li>
            <span>Like I said! I'm broke</span>
            <li><h3>Is the app free forever?</h3></li>
            <span>Yes. I made the app because I needed it myself. Then I decided to share it with the world.
                I see no reason why I should make other people pay for it.
                Fun fact! I actually made this because I didn't want to pay for something I can create myself</span>
            <li><h3>How do I support the project</h3></li>
            <span>You can become a tester. Shoot me an email if you need more info regarding this.
                This way, you can give feedback that will shape the direction of the app and make a better experience for everyone.
            You can contribute on the project on GitHub.
                The most of the work has been put in to make the code more modular and readable
                so that it's easy for other people to add in their input as PRs. You can also
                <a href="https://buymeacoff.ee/sduduzog">buy me a coffee</a>.
                I will probably buy a big mac with the cash or go watch a movie to reward myself.
                I will however spend it on the project if stated otherwise. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I don't</span>
            <li><h3>Why does this website look like crap?</h3></li>
            <span>I hit a designers block.</span>
